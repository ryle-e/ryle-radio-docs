Ryle Radio is an open-source project- my first open-source project! You can access the repository here.

The code in Ryle Radio has been fully commented and documented- if this is going to be my first open source repo, it'll certainly be a well-documented one >:)
Any questions about the code or why/how I've done particular things, please [[Contact|contact me]]! I quite don't think I differ substantially from standard programming conventions and techniques, but I'm always around in case you find something profoundly stupid or confounding :)))

Because this is my first time managing an open repository, I'm going to be a little green with pull requests and contributions (if they're actually made, my expectations are low lol). I'll be checking the repo often, so issues and requests will be read !! Feel free to implement changes or additions for whatever suits your particular application.
