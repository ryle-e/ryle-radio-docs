## Known issues
- Start and end rests on station tracks don't work - *High prio*
- New RadioTrackWrappers get linked when added in a RadioData and mirror values in their child RadioTrack - *Mid prio, attempted to fix by creating RadioDataEditor but that doesn't appear to have done it*
- Stations keep opening their dropdowns every time the inspector is switched - *Low prio, maybe mid if it gets too annoying*
- Distortion when converting between sample rates at playback time - *Low prio, [](Info/Sample%20Rates-%20an%20important%20note.md#How%20do%20we%20fix%20it?|partially%20fixed%20and%20sufficiently%20workaround-able), but would prefer a future comprehensive fix*

- More procedural audio types
- Weighted track selection in stations
