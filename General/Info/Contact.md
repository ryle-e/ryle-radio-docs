The main person you'll need to contact at this stage would be me, the writer of this package and its documentation- ryle-e, aka Ryley :)


Primary contact would be my email address: rjdwalrus@gmail.com

You can access the GitHub repository here for this package [here](https://github.com/ryle-e/ryle-radio), the repository for this documentation [here](https://github.com/ryle-e/ryle-radio-docs/), and the repository for the source documentation [here](https://github.com/ryle-e/ryle-radio-scripting-docs)!

I'm available on Reddit as [u/ryle-e_dev](https://www.reddit.com/u/ryle-e_dev), and on [itch.io](https://ryle-e.itch.io/).
If this somehow gets seen enough to warrant me putting things on Discord, I'll add that too lol

If you're feeling curious (..or some other feeling that warrants this) check out my [Unity Publisher profile](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/101853), and my other package, [MSwarms](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/mswarms-286769)! Though be warned, the documentation is far inferior to this. A work in progress, if you will :D


Thank you again for trying out my package :) This is my first open-source asset, so please flick through as much feedback as you feel inclined to !!
