## Description
### RadioData
Unlike the last two samples, we'll be looking at the RadioData object before we look at the scene for this one- a lot of what goes on in the scene won't make sense without the RadioData in mind! Let's go through the tracks.

This track is normal, except for one difference- Play on Init is toggled off! This means that the track will never play automatically or on its own- we have to manually hit play
