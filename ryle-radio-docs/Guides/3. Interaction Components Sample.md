This sample is all about the interaction components: RadioObservers and RadioInteractors. It uses a basic scene and radio, but more complex functionality.

## Accessing the sample
First, install the sample through Unity's Package Manager. Navigate to `RyleRadio/Samples/InteractionComponents`, and open `MainScene`. It should look like this:

## Description
### RadioData
Unlike the last two samples, we'll be looking at the RadioData object before we look at the scene for this one- a lot of what goes on in the scene won't make sense without the RadioData in mind! Let's go through the tracks- many of them are the same as tracks we've seen in past samples.
#### music
Ol' reliable! This track just plays a song as we're used to- nothing unusual on this one.
#### track_sfx
![[Pasted image 20251018224534.png]]
This track is normal, except for one difference- Play on Init is toggled off! This means that the track will never play automatically or on its own- we have to manually play this track. We'll find out where that happens in a little while!
#### track_sfx_silence
Now this is a strange one. This is a silent track that plays no noise. Why is it here, then?
This silent track is used to attenuate the static audio even when there's no sound playing on track_sfx above. 
Because we have to manually start the audio in track_sfx, there's going to be an amount of time where nothing is playing through that track. Usually, audio that's attenuating to the volume of a track that isn't playing anything will behave as if the track isn't there. We don't want this here, because that would make the static sound as if it's getting louder and quieter constantly! In order to prevent it from happening, then, we use this silent track to permanently lower the volume of the attenuating static track when it's in the same area as this track and track_sfx.
In short- we use silence to keep the static quiet when track_sfx isn't playing anything.
#### station_sfx
Same as track_sfx, but instead of a single audio track we use a Station. The station is identical to [[1. Basic Radio Sample#station_sfx|station_sfx]] from [[1. Basic Radio Sample]].
#### station_sfx_silence
Silence for the same reason as [[#track_sfx_silence]]- keeping the static quiet when nothing is playing on station_sfx.
#### static
The same as usual- run of the mill static with a high attenuation value so that it gets quieter when another track (including a silent one) is playing.

### Scene
With that out of the way, let's have a look at the scene for this sample.
