This sample is a basic demo intended to illustrate how a radio could be laid out, using all three default track types.

---
## Using the sample
First, install the sample through Unity's Package Manager. Navigate to `RyleRadio/Samples/BasicRadio`, and open `MainScene`. It should look like this: ![[Pasted image 20251002182350.png]]

## Description
### Scene
The scene is very simple, just containing some scene objects, some UI, and an object named Radio, which itself only has a RadioOutput (and its required AudioSource).

Double click on the link to MainData at the bottom- this will take you to the most important part of the radio :)

This is our an example of a RadioData object. This is where the content played by any output for this radio is defined- basically where you tell the radio what it is and how it works. The first thing to learn about

### The tracks
