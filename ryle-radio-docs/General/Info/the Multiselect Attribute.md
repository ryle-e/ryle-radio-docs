The Multiselelect attribute is a feature that comes alongside Ryle Radio. It allows a multiselect dropdown to be displayed in the inspector, much like a LayerMask, and a way to convert the int from that dropdown into a collection subset. 
Basically, it lets you select multiple things from a list in the inspector rather than just one :)
