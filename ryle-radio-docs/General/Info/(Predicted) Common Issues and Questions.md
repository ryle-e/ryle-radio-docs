### How do I use Ryle Radio?
Glad you asked! :)

I would recommend looking through the [[Basic Radio Sample]] to begin with, as that contains some good starter information about what a successful radio looks like. Once you've got that down pat, check out the [[Spatial Components Sample]] to learn about Broadcasters and Insulators, and finally [[Observers and Interactors Sample]] to learn about implementing more complex functionality without any code.

### How do I work with it in code?
First of all, make sure it wouldn't just be easier to use [[Observers and Interactors Sample|Observers and Interactors as described in the sample]]. If you're just playing or stopping tracks, watching for changes, or mirroring radio values, you can likely do it with those components. Because there aren't any samples that hook into Ryle Radio through custom code, your best bet is first checking out the code documentation and scripts themselves- particularly with the [[RadioObserver|Observers]] and [[RadioInteractor|Interactors]] to get a general feel of how to link in with radios.

It's very possible, if not likely, that this documentation won't be enough for the specific thing you're trying to do :( If this happens to be the case, [[Contact|contact me]]! I'm very happy to lend a hand with specific issues or plans, and very open to introducing new features if necessary.
