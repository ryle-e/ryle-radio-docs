The main person you'll need to contact at this stage would be me, the writer of this package and its documentation- ryle-e, aka Ryley :)

Primary contact would be my email address: rjdwalrus@gmail.com

You can add an issue on the GitHub repository here:
I'm available on Reddit as [u/ryle-e_dev](https://www.reddit.com/u/ryle-e_dev)
If this somehow gets seen enough to warrant me putting things on Discord, I'll add that too lol

Thank you again for trying out my package :) This is my first open-source asset, so please flick through as much feedback as you feel inclined to !!
