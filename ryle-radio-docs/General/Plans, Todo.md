## Known issues
- Distortion when converting between sample rates at playback time
- Gain value of a higher priority track directly affects attenuation of lower priority tracks- that is, if the gain is low on a high prio track, anything underneath it that attenuates will be louder than it should be
- Name of track list in Stations is incorrect (appears to be the threshold value above it?)

## Future features
- A type of RadioTrack that adds simple effects and filters- e.g: distortion, lowpass, something that resembles interference
- More procedural audio types

---
## Added features
- Track attenuation- making some tracks quieter when another is playing (see )
- Stations- tracks of tracks?
- Spatial broadcasters
- Dead zones
